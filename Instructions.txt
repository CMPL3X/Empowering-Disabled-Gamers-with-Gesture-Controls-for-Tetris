1) Test camera ports
2) Choose if you want face or mouth tracking, or just use without (not recommended)
	Insert main camera port into the CamSimFace.py / CamSimLips.py code
3) Run the CamSimFace.py / CamSimLips.py code and check with the cameraPortTest.py
	witch camera is the new one.
4) Get the Main.py code and put the new generated camera port into the
	main code.
5) Make a model using the teachablemachine. Use the generated camera.
6) Test if good enough (better > 200 pictures and delete bad ones)
7) Download (Tensorflow -> Keras -> Download)
8) Unzip
9) Put the .h5 and .txt files you got from the teachablemachine
	into the same folder as Main.py
10) To run the app : first run The CamSimFace.py and then Main.py

When you run the Main.py code, there will be 30 sec timer, before
	the code starts working. It will give you time to start
	tetr.io game.
