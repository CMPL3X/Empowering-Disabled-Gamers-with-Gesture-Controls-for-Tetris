Option 1

By Device Index:
If your USB camera is the only camera connected, you can specify its device index.
The device index 0 represents the default camera, and other cameras are typically assigned higher indices.
For example, if your USB camera is the second camera connected, you can specify it like this:

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1)  # Use device index 1 for the second camera
Adjust the index accordingly based on your system setup.

You can find out camera port with theese commands :
1    sudo apt-get install v4l-utils
2    v4l2-ctl --list-devices




Option 2

By URI (if supported by your camera):
Some USB cameras support using URIs for device identification. In this case, you can specify the camera by its URI:

cap = cv2.VideoCapture("your_camera_uri_here")
Replace "your_camera_uri_here" with the actual URI of your USB camera if it supports this method.
