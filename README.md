Im not going to use external compute modules (Like the coral board or raspberry pi), because there were some weird software errors, so im going to do this the easy way - a python pc app

**What problem are you going to solve?**
Many disabled individuals face barriers when trying to engage in online gaming, which can limit their access to entertainment, social interaction, and skill development. Traditional gaming interfaces may not be adaptable to their needs, making it difficult for them to fully participate in the gaming community.
